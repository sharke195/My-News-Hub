   	<h1> Major Running News in Cheboygan </h1>
   	<p> The cross country team in Cheboygan has been making some serious moves against their competition recently. Their most recent win was in Indian River on Monday the 23rd. The girls team took <b>first</b> out of ten other teams! This is one of many wins for the girls team this season, the team may be young but it has grown a lot in the past couple seasons. In the 21-22 season the team only had seven people including boys and girls, now the team has grown to be around nineteen runners. The girls team has more people with eleven, the boys have just over enough for a varsity team with eight runners. </p>
